## Workshop: Georeferencing Historical Maps using Map Warper
*By saman goudarzi (cartogrpahic resources librarian, Mills Memorial Library)*

This is the accompanying workshop to the **Friendly Introduction to Print & Digital Carto Resources for Historians** instructional session. You can download the session slides [here]().

# Workshop Objectives

Georeferencing is the process of embedding location information (such as geographic coordinates) to a scanned map or raster image. Many historians are now [georeferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeferencing) historical maps in order to study temporal changes. In this workshop, you will: (1) find a digitized historical cartographic resource within the McMaster Digital map collection, (2) add geographic coordinates to this resource using Map Warper.

While there are several advanced mapping tools that enable georeferencing, this aim of this workshop is to provide you with an example of an entry-level georeferencing tool. [Map Warper](https://mapwarper.net/), an open-source tool created and hosted by Tim Waters, allows users to upload and georeference raster images.

## Step 1: Explore [McMaster's Historical & Rare Maps Collection](https://library.mcmaster.ca/collections/historical-rare-maps)

## Step 2: Choose and download a map from this collection to georeference 

Things to keep in mind when decision-making:

* Choose a high quality image (300 dpi or greater)
* Large scale maps (maps that show a smaller area of the world in detail) are better suited for detailed georeferencing 
* Areas with man-made features (roads, railroad tracks, highways) are easier to georeference than those with solely 'natural' features
* I recommend choosing a map that covers an area you are familiar with

## Step 3: Set up a [Map Warper](https://mapwarper.net/) account and upload your map

## Step 4: Explore the Map Warper platform

## Step 5: Georeference your map

Add at least 5-6 control points to your historical image. Keep in mind that good control points are stable locations or landmarks that would not have changed during the time period between your chosen historical map and the contemporary web map (road intersections are an especially great). 

## Step 6: Save your newly georeferenced map and share it with the rest of the class

# Conclusion

Congrats on georeferencing your first map! Having learned this new skill means that you can now bring historic cartographic resources into the present context and explore them in new ways.
